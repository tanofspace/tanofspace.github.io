						<h3><b>Joanne Tan (@tanofspace)</b> </h3>
						<p>I am a PhD researcher at the <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics (MPA)</a>, as part of the <a href="https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/" target="_blank">IMPRS on Astrophysics</a> program. I primarily work with <a href="https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~naab/naab/Welcome.html" target="_blank"> Dr. Thorsten Naab</a> on topics broadly related to the cosmological formation and evolution of massive galaxies. My current research focuses on studying the multiphase circumgalactic medium (CGM) -- we probe into metal absorption lines to trace the various phases of the CGM in cosmological simulations, in hopes to better understand the enigmatic CGM. 
						<p>Check out my research <a href="research.html" target="_blank">here</a>!

					<section id="why">
						<h3><b>Why "tanofspace"?</b> </h3>
						<p>Well, because there is a ton of space! *ba dum tss* and because there is a piece of space for everyone.
						</p>
						<p>In all seriousness, it's just me playing a pun on my last name. My last name "Tan" is pronounced just like the word "ton" (in both American and British English), instead of something one gets after prolonged sun-exposure. It is also definitely not the two-digit number one gets from multiplying 2 and 5 :> 
						</p>
						<p>
						PS. It is also because I am tired of my name being pronounced incorrectly, so hopefully, this will help!
						</p>
						<p>
						PPS. If, at this point, you are wondering whether I am related to the other Jo* Tan's in astronomy, I have to let you know that unfortunately, the answer is no. Thought I should address this in case it gets asked again. 
						</p>

						<h3><b>My academic journey prior to MPA</b> </h3>
						<p>Before coming to MPA, I completed my master's degree in <a href="https://physics.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">astronomy</a> at <a href="https://tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a> in May 2020. There, my research focused on tidal disruption events in AGNs hosted by dwarf galaxies, and stellar kinematics of massive galaxies as a means of black hole mass measurement. I also completed a concentration in astrostatistics. </p>

						<p> Taking another step back chronologically, I completed my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a> (Go Bears!), with a double major in <a href="https://astro.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">astrophysics</a> and <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">physics</a>, in Dec 2019. My research project then focuses on estimating the rotation periods of Kepler/Gaia stars due to stellar activities. I also dabbled in ancient astronomy, in which we use astronomical data to date Neo-Assyrian letters.

					<section id="origin">
						<h3><b>More of my journey</b> </h3>
						<p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuching" target="_blank">Kuching</a>, Sarawak, a small city located on the northwestern region of the Borneo Island. I then moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur" target="_blank">Kuala Lumpur</a>, the capital of Malaysia, for pre-university studies, before moving to the United States to pursue my undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley. After four years in Berkeley, I then moved halfway across the continental US to pursue grauate education at Texas A&M University. Two years later, I moved yet again, this time to Munich, Germany, a city where some considers the heart of Europe. Following this trend, it is reasonable to conjecture that the future holds a few more (but please just a few more!) moves around the world.

					<section id="life">
						<h3><b>Life outside of astronomy</b> </h3>
						<p>During my meager free time (after accounting for procrastination), I enjoy playing video games, lurking (way too much) on Reddit, and watching Netflix. 
						</p>

						<p>I also enjoy cooking, so I have definitely watched way too many food videos on YouTube (in my defense, for new ideas and inspiration!). This relates to another interest of mine: going on food adventures, either solo or with friends. I love exploring and hunting for the best food around meâ€”whether it's trying new cuisines or discovering new food places, they always keep me excited.
						</p>

						<p>Besides that, I also enjoy chasing and photographing sunsets (and sunrises too, when they happen after 7am :>). I might consider compiling the sunrises/sunsets I've photographed into a photo gallery too, stay tuned! :> Travelling and seeing as much of the world as I can are also passions of mine. 
						</p>

						<p>Last but not least, writing fiction and poetry has also slowly gain a stronghold in my ever-growing list of interests. At times, I find myself randomly getting inspired to craft a haiku or two.</p>

						<h3><b>Doggos? Doggos!</b> </h3>
						<p>Dogs are one of my greatest loves, as I grew up with many doggos at home. This means that I will always be partial to dogs, and I will be extremely happy when anyone sends me pictures or videos of doggos.
